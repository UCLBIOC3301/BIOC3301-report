# BIOC3301-report
Methods for data analysis of soil metadata.
This Github repository is for the analysis of soil taken from Gordon Square Park in the Autumn of 2017. 


Remember to talk about this
The files contain several lines of codes starting with #, which are instructions for the HPC job queue. Such as how long the job will run on how many cores, how much RAM and storage is required.

For 2016's data both reads were joined, prior to de-multiplexing. As 2017's second read data was of lower quality, joining was skipped and only read1 was processed.
